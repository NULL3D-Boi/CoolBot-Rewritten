Do you like how I dance? I've got zirconium pants
Consequential enough to slip you into a trance
Do you like how I walk? Do you like how I talk?
Do you like how my face disintegrates into chalk?
I have a wonderful wife, I have a powerful job
She criticizes me for being egocentric
You practice your mannerisms into the wall
If this mirror were clearer, I'd be standing so tall
I saw you slobber over clovers on the side of the hill
I was observing the birds (circle in for the kill)
I've been you, I know you, your facade is a scam
You know you're making me cry, this is the way that I am
I've been living a lie, a metamorphical scheme
Detective undercover, brotherhood, objective, obscene
Oh, no, no, oh yeah
